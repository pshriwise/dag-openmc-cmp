mcnp_n_adapted.inp - Copied the SINBAD input file and commented out 2 volumes
that were void space (cells 229 and 241).

mcnp_n_adapted.sat - MCNP2CAD of mcnp_n_adapted.inp. Used Cubit to look at all volumes that are unassigned. Reassigned volumes according to MCNP input file.
MCNP mat 1, cubit group 3:
    MCNP_ID_240 -> cubit vols 151 152
MCNP mat 10, cubit group 2:
    MCNP_ID_178 -> cubit vols 131 132
    MCNP_ID_238 -> cubit vols 149 150
MCNP mat 4, cubit group 6
    MCNP_ID_52 -> cubit vols 54 55
    MCNP_ID_21 -> cubit vols 22 23

mcnp_n_adapted.h5m - dagmc_preproc of mcnp_n_adapted.sat

mcnp_n_adapted_zip.h5m - make_watertight of mcnp_n_adapted.sat

mcnp_n_adapted_dag.inp - DAG-MCNP version of the input file. Only data cards. No sdef.
"idum 2" was added to use the neutron source.F90. The Cubit volume of the source cell is 2.
In addition the follwing subsititions are made in order to use FENDL2.1 data:
15000 -> 15031
41000 -> 41093
6000  ->  6012
42000 -> Use the following script
######
from pyne.nucname import id
from pyne.data import natural_abund
total = -2.00
for x in [42092, 42094, 42095, 42096, 42097, 42098, 42100]:
    print("{}.21c {}".format(x, total*natural_abund(id(x))))
